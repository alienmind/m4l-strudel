/**
 * device.ts - the Strudel-specific half of the [js] glue.
 *
 * @m4l-jweb/wrapper already provides the lifecycle (bang/loadbang, the
 * anything() guard), the self-extracting UI payload, the LiveAPI transport poll,
 * the tempo observer and clip I/O. This file is compiled and concatenated after
 * those, as one ES5 script, so it can see and extend them.
 *
 * What is genuinely ours:
 *   1. The device mode (midi | sample-browser), which gates the two below.
 *   2. clip_available: a poll, because LiveAPI has no observer for "any clip on
 *      this track", so the UI can disable From Clip when there is nothing to read.
 *   3. Live 12's global root_note/scale_name, forwarded to the UI.
 *
 * WHAT IS NO LONGER OURS: the [node.script] bootstrap, and the fan-out of tick and
 * tempo to outlet 1 that fed it. The sample browser has no process of its own since
 * m4l-jweb 0.6.0 - it fetches its catalog in the page, plays previews in the page
 * (0.9.9, through the `webaudio` chain) and writes the file through the `download`
 * chain - and outlet 1 now belongs to the packaged wrapper, which answers
 * `fetch_to_file` and the `save_*` requests on it. Writing to it by hand from here
 * would be talking over the library.
 *
 * Everything here is ES5 and gated by acorn, same as the packaged sources.

 *    it, and a relative path cannot be split into atoms by the spaces in "Ableton
 *    Library". But the USER has to be able to get at the file: to drag it into a
 *    Simpler, to find it in Places. A page cannot know its own device's folder, so the
 *    wrapper tells it - once, at ui_ready.
 *
 *    deviceFolder() is the packaged core's, and it is the SAME resolution the
 *    save used, which is what makes the path we hand the page the real one.
 *
 * 2. LIVE'S GLOBAL QUANTIZATION. The preview starts on a beat, and WHICH beat is not
 *    ours to decide - the user already told Live, in the transport bar. `1 Bar` means
 *    a preview waits for the downbeat; `None` means it plays now. Anything else is a
 *    device inventing its own timing rules next to the ones the set already has.

 * Transport follow (TODO item 0)
 *
 * A sequencing device should start when the music starts. Until now the page's Play
 * parameter was the only way in: pressing Play in Live, or launching a clip on the
 * device's track, left the pattern silent until somebody also clicked the device.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS "PLAYING" is the UNION of the two signals Live offers, because there
 * is no single LOM property for it:
 *
 *   - `playing_slot_index >= 0` - a session clip is running on this device's track.
 *   - `live_set is_playing` - the global transport is running.
 *
 * Either one starts the device; it stops when BOTH are false.
 *
 * The first version was cleverer and worse. It asked whether the track held any clip
 * and, if it did, followed ONLY the clips - so a Drums Sampler on a track that merely
 * HAD a clip in some slot sat silent when you pressed Play, because nothing had been
 * launched. "Press Play, hear the instrument" is the rule every other device in Live
 * has already taught the user, and quietly opting out of it reads as broken.
 *
 * The cost is the other direction: stopping a clip while the transport keeps running
 * leaves the device playing. That is the honest reading of "the transport is running",
 * and the Play parameter is still there to stop it by hand.
 *
 * Both are observed, never polled. The page receives `transport_play <0|1>` and
 * writes its Play parameter, so an automation lane or a Rack macro still overrides
 * it - the follow only acts on the EDGES of Live's own state.
