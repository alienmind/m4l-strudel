/**
 * build-ui.mjs - bundle one self-contained UI per device, plus one per WINDOW.
 *
 * Emits dist/ui/<device>/index.html (the device view) and, for every window a
 * device declares in its surface.ts, dist/ui/<device>/<winId>.html. `m4l-jweb
 * build` then embeds all of them into the matching .amxd as base64 payloads.
 *
 * Sequential, not parallel: vite reads DEVICE from the environment, and two
 * concurrent builds would race on it.
 *
 * THE RENAME DANCE around the window builds is load-bearing. Vite always writes
 * its entry as index.html, so a window build lands on top of the device view we
 * just produced - and emptyOutDir cannot be left on for it either (vite.config.ts
 * gates it on WINDOW), or the window build wipes the folder. So the device view
 * is moved aside, the windows are built and renamed one by one, and it is moved
 * back.
