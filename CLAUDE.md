# CLAUDE.md - working rules for agents in this repo

This repo builds the Strudel family of Ableton Live devices on top of the
`m4l-jweb` library (its own repo, sibling checkout). Start with `README.md`, then
`doc/ARCHITECTURE.md` for how the layers fit, and `doc/TODO.md` for what is in
flight. This file is only the house rules - the things that are not derivable
from the code.

## Asking for a test in Live

Nothing here can be proven without Live, so a change lands as a build to be
tested by hand. Make that request SCHEMATIC:

1. Name the EXACT device - `alienmind-strudel`, not "the device".
2. A table, and little else: check number, what to do, what should happen.
3. One line on what is expected to still be broken at this stop.
4. Ask for the result by check NUMBER, plus the Max console output.

Do NOT re-explain how Live works. In particular, never repeat that Live embeds a
copy of a device per set, or that an existing instance has to be deleted and
re-dragged to pick up a build. That is known.

Example of the whole thing:

> Test **`alienmind-strudel`**.
>
> | # | Do this | Should happen |
> |---|---------|---------------|
> | 1 | Press REPL, evaluate `note("c3 e3 g3").s("sawtooth")` | Sound on the track |
> | 2 | Save the set, reopen it | The pattern comes back |
>
> Expected still broken: the mini view's own engine still sounds separately.

## Scratch work goes in `tmp/`

Anything exploratory - an unpacked `.amxd`, a standalone spike, a scratch harness, a
dump you are reading once - goes under `tmp/`, which is gitignored. Not the repo root.

A spike that answered its question is DELETED once the answer is written down (in
`doc/MAX-FACTS.md` upstream, or `doc/DRAWER_OF_FAILED_IDEAS.md` here). The finding is
what has value; the scaffolding that produced it is noise in a tree everyone else has
to read.

## Writing

Plain ASCII punctuation in documentation, commit messages and code comments. No
em dashes, en dashes, middle dots or typographic ellipses - use `-`, `...`, `,`.
Signal-flow arrows (`->`) and glyphs standing for real UI buttons are fine.

Comments should say what the code cannot: the constraint, the trap, the thing
that was measured in Live and cost a day. Not what the next line does.
But never use cliche formulas like "this is the trap that costed us a day".
Just state the point without overextending it.

Commit messages should be schematic, one line per feature, prepend with prefixes such as:
doc -, chore -, feat -, fix -. No overextending in the commit messages. Details are
for the markdown documents.

## Recording what was learned

`doc/TODO.md` is the live ledger: what passed, what it measured, and the exact
next test. Finished work is DELETED from it rather than kept as a done-list - git
history is the record of what shipped. We may move some of the contents to some of the
following files.

`doc/DRAWER_OF_FAILED_IDEAS.md` is for approaches that were tried and did not
work, WITH the reason. A failure recorded there is worth as much as a feature -
it is what stops the same spike being run twice.

`doc/ARCHITECTURE.md` is for implementation details of everything that became a feature
and its worth noting for the future. This is the "How" is implemented, with the juicy
technical - code-based details.

`doc/README.md` is TODO items that actually became a feature that is high-level worth
mentioning for a final user because its directly observable.
We don't log implementation details here, that's for the architecture document above.

## The two repos

`m4l-jweb` is the library and this is its consumer. While both move together they
are linked (`link:../m4l-jweb/packages/*` in `package.json`), so an edit there is
live here with no publish.

Anything general - patcher codegen, the Surface, window primitives, the wrapper
protocol - belongs UPSTREAM in `m4l-jweb`, not here. Anything about these
particular devices belongs here. When in doubt, ask whether another device repo
would want it.
