/**
 * sampleCache.ts - a persistent, page-side cache in front of `fetch()`.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS (doc/TODO.md item 2). There is no render step any more: superdough
 * fetches its samples at PLAY time, so a device with no network plays synths and goes
 * silent on every `s("bd")`. Reading the bytes back off disk is not an option either -
 * Chromium blocks `fetch()` of `file://` - so the only storage a device page can reach
 * is the browser's own. jweb IS Chromium, so it has that storage; whether the CEF
 * profile keeps it across a Live restart is the one thing this file cannot decide for
 * itself (see the spike note at the bottom).
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. `installSampleCache()` wraps the global `fetch`. Sample bytes are
 * served CACHE FIRST - a sample at a given URL is immutable in practice, and a hit
 * costs no network at all, which is as good for a slow connection as it is for none.
 * Sample MAPS (the .json manifests) are fetched NETWORK FIRST and fall back to the
 * cache, so a map that gains sounds upstream is not pinned to whatever was stored
 * first. Everything else passes straight through untouched.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO DO. It never turns a failure into a silent success and it never
 * throws out of the wrapper: every storage operation is wrapped, and a broken (or
 * disabled, or partitioned) IndexedDB degrades to an in-memory cache for the session.
 * A cache that can take the page down with it is worse than no cache.
