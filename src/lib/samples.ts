/**
 * samples.ts - Strudel's sample-map universe, resolved in the PAGE.
 *
 * This is the catalog half of the sample browser: turn `github:tidalcycles/dirt-samples`
 * or `shabda:piano` into a list of sounds and the absolute URLs behind them. It used
 * to live in a [node.script] process, for one reason only - nothing else in the stack
 * could reach the network. [jweb] is Chromium and has always had fetch(); the catalog
 * is small JSON and it belongs in the UI that renders it.
 *
 * The pseudo-URL resolution is ported from strudel/packages/superdough/sampler.mjs
 * (`processSampleMap`). Keep it in step by hand; it is tiny.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE: downloading, and playing. Those cannot happen in the page - the
 * file has to be on DISK for Max to read it ([maxurl] writes it), and audio the page
 * plays for itself goes to the OS output device rather than through the track. See
 * doc/ARCHITECTURE.md section 3d.
