 * disk is the drag-out handle. One fetch feeds both: the bytes are decoded for

 * the same folder - there is no other way to hear it. Two buttons implied two
 * outcomes. So auditioning IS acquiring, a row is a single click (or an arrow key),
 * and what you get afterwards is a HANDLE ON THE FILE: drag it into a Simpler, a Drum
 * Rack, or a track.
