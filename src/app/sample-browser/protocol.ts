/**
 * protocol.ts (sample-browser) - every selector that crosses this device's bridge.
 *
 * There is almost nothing left to declare, and that is the whole story of this
 * release. This device used to own a private protocol - `catalog`, `downloaded`,
 * `progress`, `fetcherr`, `engine_ready`, `preview` - because it talked to a
 * [node.script] process of its own that did the fetching, the downloading and the
 * previewing, and every reply came back base64-encoded through it.
 *
 * Fetching and previewing are the page's own work now - `fetch()` for the bytes,
 * `decodeAudioData` + an AudioBufferSourceNode for the sound, out through the
 * `webaudio` chain's signal path. The only job still crossing the bridge is WRITING
 * the audited file to disk, so it can be dragged into a track: `save_begin` /
 * `save_chunk` / `save_end` / `save_done` (the `download` chain), which CHAIN_OUT and
 * CHAIN_IN carry and `saveToFile()` wraps. The app never types those names.
 *
 * What is left is genuinely this device's own: Live's global scale, which the
 * browser shows so a pitched sample map can be read in the key of the set.
