/**
 * Strudel Audio FX - an audio effect. Sits anywhere in an audio chain and applies
 * a Strudel effects line to whatever audio is already coming into the track.
 *
 * The whole interface is ONE LINE plus the sliders for whatever that line names.
 * There is no pattern editor, no Bars/Grid/Octave, no To Clip - none of the MIDI
 * device's UI belongs here, because this device sequences nothing.
 *
 * THE PARAMETERS ARE THE TRUTH, and the line is a VIEW OF THEM. This is the whole
 * design of the screen, and getting it the other way round is what makes these
 * devices misbehave: if the text box were also authoritative, then a Push encoder,
 * an automation lane and a keystroke would each be writing a value the other two
 * would immediately overwrite. So:
 *
 *   - the dials/automation/Push write the parameters, and the line REDRAWS from
 *     them, always, for free - there is no sync to run and nothing to keep in step;
 *   - typing edits a DRAFT, which is the user's alone until they commit it with
 *     Enter (or leave the box). Committing writes the parameters; the draft is then
 *     dropped and the line goes back to being a view.
 *
 * It works because format and parse are exact inverses over quantized values (see
 * lib/fx.ts): the line a slider redraws is the same line that would set it.
 *
 * Live's device view is a FIXED ~169px tall. Every row here is budgeted.
