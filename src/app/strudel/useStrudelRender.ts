/**
 * The native Web Audio sink for the Strudel device.
 *
 * TWO CLOCKS, AND WHY delayMs IS THE WRONG BRIDGE BETWEEN THEM. The worker schedules
 * against Live's transport and hands each hap a `delayMs` measured from the beat
 * position of the TICK it was queried in. That works for the MIDI devices because Max's
 * [pipe] applies the delay on Max's own scheduler - the number never leaves the clock it
 * was computed on. Here it does: by the time the event has crossed postMessage and
 * React, an unknown slice of that delay is already spent, and `currentTime + delayMs`
 * quietly means something later than it says.
 *
 * The first attempt clamped a late event to "now" so superdough would not drop it (it
 * refuses to schedule in the past). That is worse than dropping: once the clocks drift
 * past the lookahead window EVERY event clamps to the same instant, so a bar's worth of
 * notes fires simultaneously - which is exactly the reported symptom, audio that starts,
 * collapses, spikes the CPU and distorts, then loosely resumes.
 *
 * So do not convert a delay at all. Anchor the pattern's own timeline to the audio
 * clock ONCE, and derive every event from it: `t = anchorTime + (cycle - anchorCycle) /
 * cps`. Spacing then comes from the pattern (exact, jitter-free) rather than from
 * message arrival times, and superdough is handed strictly increasing future times.
 *
 * The anchor is re-taken only when it is genuinely meaningless: the first event, a
 * tempo change, or a computed time that has fallen behind or run absurdly ahead -
 * transport start/stop, a loop jump, a scrub, or the page being throttled. Each re-anchor
 * is a one-off timing seam, so they are counted and reported rather than hidden.
