/**
 * m4l-shim.js - the ONLY thing this repo adds to the stock strudel.cc page.
 *
 * scripts/build-repl.mjs injects it into the built site with a <script> tag. The
 * submodule is never patched: the app stays the app, with its own engine, its own
 * scheduler and all its visualisers, and this file drives it from outside through
 * two globals that already exist -
 *
 *   window.max            injected by jweb into every page it loads (bindInlet/outlet)
 *   window.strudelMirror  the StrudelMirror editor (website/src/repl/useReplContext.jsx)
 *
 * It is plain ES5-ish JavaScript with no imports on purpose: it is copied into a
 * built site, not bundled with it, so it can depend on nothing but the page.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, and why each one is not optional:
 *
 *   1. ARMS THE AUDIO. The REPL waits for a `mousedown` on the document before it
 *      creates an AudioContext (initAudioOnFirstClick, superdough.mjs). A window
 *      that loads hidden at device load never gets one, so the device would be
 *      silent until the user opened the Studio and clicked in it.
 *
 *   2. PINS THE OUTPUT DEVICE. `initAudio({ audioDeviceName })` calls `setSinkId`
 *      for any device that is not the default - which would steer the sound to a
 *      sound card and AWAY from the [jweb~] outlets that are the track. A setting
 *      left over from a browser session would silently take the device off the
 *      track, so the saved value is forced back to the default.
 *
 *   3. PERSISTS THE PATTERN into the device's `code` state slot, so it saves with
 *      the LIVE SET rather than in this page's localStorage. The Live set is what
 *      a musician backs up, moves between machines and expects to reopen intact.
 *
 *   4. TAKES PLAY/STOP AND THE KNOBS from the device view, which is where Live's
 *      transport, Push and the automation lanes reach.

	 * The eight native dials, for a pattern to read: `m4lKnob(1)`..`m4lKnob(8)`.
	 *
	 * IT RETURNS A SIGNAL, NOT A NUMBER, and that is the whole point.
	 *
	 * A pattern is evaluated once and then plays for as long as you leave it. So a
	 * plain number is read at EVALUATION time and frozen there - `.lpf(200 +
	 * m4lKnob(1) * 2000)` sounds right, and then the knob does nothing until you
	 * evaluate again. That is not a knob, it is a default.
	 *
	 * A signal is queried by the scheduler every cycle instead, so the value is read
	 * WHILE THE PATTERN PLAYS and the dial moves the sound under your hand.
	 *
	 *     note("c3 e3 g3").s("sawtooth").lpf(m4lKnob(1).range(200, 2200))
	 *
	 * A dial can also DESCRIBE ITSELF, which is what the surface declarations do for
	 * every other parameter in this repo - a name, a unit, a range:
	 *
	 *     m4lKnob(1, { name: 'cutoff', unit: 'Hz', range: [200, 2200] })
	 *     m4lKnob(2, { name: 'room' })
	 *
	 * Single quotes there are not a style choice, though double ones are handled
	 * too: in the REPL a DOUBLE-quoted string is mini notation, rewritten into a
	 * pattern before the code runs, so `name: "cutoff"` arrives as an object. See
	 * asText().
	 *
	 * All of it optional, and `range` here is the same range `.range()` applies -
	 * given here, the returned signal is already scaled, so it reads once rather
	 * than twice. Name, unit and range are sent through the library's own parameter
	 * vocabulary (`param_label` / `param_unit` / `param_range`), which is what renames
	 * and re-ranges a native dial.
	 *
	 * KNOWN LIMIT, measured before this branch (doc/TODO.md item 5): the rename
	 * takes on the DEVICE PANEL but does NOT reach Live's parameter registry or the
	 * Rack macro picker, which keep showing S1..S8 - a frozen device cannot rename a
	 * parameter there. The unit is carried for the same reason: so that when a route
	 * to Live's own naming exists, the pattern is already saying what it means.
	 *
	 * `signal` reaches globalThis when the REPL loads its modules (evalScope in
	 * @strudel/core), which is after this file runs - hence the lookup at call time.
	 * Before it exists, the number is the honest fallback.
	 *
	 * `m4lKnobValue(n)` is the raw number, for a pattern that genuinely wants the
	 * value frozen at evaluation.

	 * 5. THE PATTERN'S OWN slider() CALLS, on the device's dials.
	 *
	 * `m4lKnob()` is ours, and asking a Strudel coder to learn it just to reach a
	 * Live knob is a tax on the wrong person. `slider()` is what they already write,
	 * and everything needed to adopt it is public already:
	 *
	 *   READ  - after each evaluation `strudelMirror.widgets` holds every slider as
	 *           { id, from, to, value, min, max, step }, `id` being the character
	 *           range of the first argument and ascending `from` being source order.
	 *   WRITE - `window.postMessage({ type: 'cm-slider', id, value })` sets
	 *           `sliderValues[id]`, which the pattern's `ref()` reads on its next
	 *           query. The inline widget posts exactly this when dragged.
	 *
	 * WHAT A DIAL DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: dragging the inline slider also REWRITES
	 * THE CODE TEXT (`view.dispatch({ changes })`). A Live dial does not, because
	 * automation moves it dozens of times a second and rewriting the document at that
	 * rate would fight the typing and keep the set permanently dirty. So the sound
	 * follows the dial while the number in the code stays as written - it is the
	 * DECLARED value. The widget's thumb is nudged directly in the DOM, which costs
	 * nothing and stops the page looking frozen.
	 *
	 * NAMES AND UNITS. `slider(500, 100, 1000, 1, { name: 'cutoff', unit: 'Hz' })`
	 * already runs in stock strudel - the transpiler reads the first four arguments
	 * and `sliderWithID` ignores the rest - but the options are DROPPED, so they
	 * cannot be read back from the widget. Until upstream carries them through
	 * (doc/FEAT-SLIDERS.md), they are parsed out of the code here. The parse fails
	 * soft: no name is a fine outcome, and the slider still lands on a dial with its
	 * real range.
