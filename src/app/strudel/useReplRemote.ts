 * Carry the device's LIVE-FACING controls into the REPL window.
 *
 * The Studio owns the engine, but Live's transport, Push, the automation lanes and
 * the Rack macros all reach the DEVICE, not a floating window: a parameter exists
 * in the patcher, and a knob turn is delivered to the device view's page and to
 * nothing else. So the device view is the only place that can hear a knob move, and
 * this hook is what passes it on.
 *
 * `sendToWindow` and not a state slot on purpose - a slot saves with the set, and a
 * knob being swept would write the Live set on every frame. The pattern persists
 * (that is a slot); a knob position in flight does not.
 *
 * The receiving end is `repl-shim/m4l-shim.js`, which turns `set_play` into
 * evaluate/stop and keeps `set_s1..s8` for the pattern to read as `m4lKnob(n)`.
