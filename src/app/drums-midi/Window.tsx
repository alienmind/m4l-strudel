/**
 * The EXPANDED drum rack - a floating window, opened optionally from the device
 * view's "Expand" button. It is the SAME DrumRack the mini view draws, given a wide
 * range (C1..C6) instead of a 16-pad window, so there is no scroll stripe: it shows
 * every pad at once and larger.
 *
 * It binds the `drumMap` state slot with useStateSync, exactly as the device does, so
 * a change here and a change in the mini rack are one write to one persisted [dict]
 * and the library keeps every open view in sync.
 *
 * A SEPARATE bundle from App.tsx (surface.ts declares `entry: "Window"`), with its
 * own Chromium context: it shares no React state with the device view and reaches it
 * only through Max - which is what useStateSync does under the hood.
