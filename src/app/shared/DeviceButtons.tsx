/**
 * The top-bar buttons every device draws, as ONE definition each.
 *
 * They were copies. Six devices each wrote their own `<Button icon={Play} ...>` with its
 * own title text, its own decision about whether to show a label, and its own idea of
 * where in the row it belonged - which is how the MIDI device ended up with "Run"/"Clip"
 * word chips, the FX device with a "Knobs" chip, and the Strudel device with neither. A
 * user who learns a control on one device has learnt nothing about the next one.
 *
 * ICON ONLY, everywhere. A device view is ~169px tall and its top bar is one row; a word
 * costs a third of that row to say what the icon and the tooltip already say. The tooltip
 * carries the full sentence, which is where an explanation belongs.
 *
 * These take callbacks rather than a surface: the hooks (`useParam`, `useWindow`) must be
 * called in the device's own component against the device's own surface - see HelpButton,
 * which has done it this way since the beginning.
