# Changelog

High-level history of m4l-strudel, grouped by milestone release. Up to 1.0.0 each
minor version was a milestone of its own. Newest first.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-21

The v1.0.0 backlog, cleared: the transport drives the devices, samples survive going
offline, there is a MIDI-played synth, and the main device gets its plain name.

- **`alienmind-strudel-superdough` is now `alienmind-strudel`.** The engine is still
  superdough; the DEVICE is the whole language, so it carries the plain name. Every
  parameter and state slot name is unchanged. An existing Live set embeds its own copy
  of the old device and keeps working - re-add the device to move a set onto the new
  name.
- **No Instrument Racks in the distribution.** Both `.adg` presets are withdrawn: a Live
  rack embeds a copy of every device it holds, so a shipped rack is a snapshot that goes
  stale the moment a device is rebuilt. The devices are the distribution.
- **The transport starts the device.** Launching a clip on the track starts the pattern
  and stopping it stops the pattern; on a track with no clips, Live's global Play does
  the same. The wrapper resolves which signal applies and the page writes it into the
  automatable Play parameter, so a click, an automation lane and a launched clip all move
  one control.
- **Offline sample cache.** Every sample and sample map fetched by any device is stored
  in the page (IndexedDB, with a session fallback) and served cache first, so a set
  reopened with no network still plays the sounds it played before.
- **Strudel Synth** (`alienmind-strudel-synth`): one superdough sound - `s("sawtooth")
  .lpf(800).room(.3)`, a value rather than a pattern - played by the track's MIDI. The
  eight native slider knobs work here too. Note length is decided at trigger time
  (superdough schedules a whole envelope up front), so holding a key does not hold the
  note.
- **Clipboard copy stopped lying.** "Copy folder path" reported success on a page that
  had copied nothing - `execCommand("copy")` returns true in jweb and writes nothing, and
  a `file://` page cannot read the clipboard back to check. No claim is trusted inside
  jweb now: the path is shown pre-selected and the browser's own `copy` event is the
  confirmation. **Still unverified in Live** - see below.
- **Shared device chrome.** The top-bar buttons (Run/Stop, Clip, Controls, Export) are one
  shared component each, icon-only on every device, so a control learnt on one device is
  the same control on the next. The slider row no longer draws a scrollbar over itself.
- **`pnpm build` cleans `dist/` first.** It never did, so a renamed device left its old
  `.amxd` behind and `install:device` faithfully copied the ghost into the User Library.

**Known issues in 1.0.0**

- **Export fails on the Strudel device**: `could not place save: -1 bytes at destination`.
  The render completes; the file never lands. Tracked as TODO item 0.
- **The clipboard copy is untested**, because the Copy button only appears once Export has
  written something. TODO item 1.

## 0.9.5 - 2026-07-19

All of Strudel as the track's audio: the **Strudel Superdough** instrument.

- **Strudel Superdough** (`alienmind-strudel-superdough`): write anything strudel.cc plays
  - multi-line `$:`, samples, synths, orbits, superdough's real effects - and the device
  renders it **offline with the real superdough engine** into a WAV that Max loops on the
  track, locked to Live's transport, crossfading to each fresh render at the loop boundary.
  Deterministic patterns loop one period; random patterns drop to **rolling mode** (one
  realization per loop, with a visible notice). Edits fade in at the next boundary.
- **Follows Live's tempo.** The pattern speeds up / slows with the BPM and the loop stays
  bar-locked at any tempo; a re-render on tempo change keeps the lock. A `setcpm()` in the
  code OVERRIDES this to pin the pattern's own rate - default follows Live, `setcpm` is your
  own clock.
- **Slider knobs.** Every `slider()` in the code becomes a web slider AND binds to
  one of eight native dials (S1..S8) - macro-mappable, on Push - auto-bound by order; a turn
  re-renders. The dial takes the code's name for it (`lpf`, `gain`) on the device panel.
- **Fixes this pass:** serialized renders now also clear superdough's cross-context node
  pool (kills the intermittent "cannot connect to an AudioNode belonging to a different
  audio context" on rapid Play/Stop); dials reset their name when a slider is removed; the
  Controls button moved to the top bar and the debug readout to About.
- Reverted: a runtime `_parameter_range` spike to carry the slider's real range on the
  native dial - it shifts the value domain and breaks the normalized knob math. The dials
  stay 0..1; the app denormalises. The general fix (a Surface-declared native-knob pool) is
  in the m4l-jweb backlog.

## 0.9.1 - 2026-07-19

Pattern as a first-class signal, a bank-based sampler, and one consistent chrome.

- **Drums Sampler** (was Sampler): code-driven. `s("bd sd, hh*8")` plays a
  drum-machine **bank** (strudel's `bank()`), samples auto-download from the
  tidal-drum-machines repo, 16 voices with an LRU name->slot allocator, and a MIDI
  sequencer in front drives it. Accepts bare expressions (`bd sd, hh!6`) and has its
  own `?` reference.
- **One device chrome**: a single grey `Button` across every device; the `?` sits
  rightmost; the native panels (MIDI Play/Stop) and Full Studio moved into
  **About > Advanced** (FX keeps its top-bar Knobs). MIDI options (octave/shift/scale)
  demoted to a small bottom row.
- **Renames**: `midi-drums` -> `drums-midi`, `sampler` -> `drums-sampler`,
  `sampler-browser` -> `sample-browser` (screen + disk).
- Pattern-driven modulation: patterns drive fx parameters on the tick, with
  remote values pre-warped for the knob exponent.
- fx: `.hpf()` and `.crush()` promoted to real stages; a line that takes signals.
- The Full Studio window, with the pattern kept as state that survives the set.
- A reference window listing which Strudel features each device supports.
- Drag-a-sample-into-a-clip: tried (`DownloadURL`) and failed - CEF strips the
  payload; parked. "Show folder" is the answer.
- Runs on m4l-jweb 0.9.1.

## 0.8.x - 2026-07-13 to 2026-07-16

Native Live surfaces, a real engine, and a shipping pipeline.

- fx device sheds HTML sliders for native Live dials (two-screen web UI vs.
  native knob panel, reflowed via useNativeLayout / useNativePanel).
- Drum-rack editor; empty-map silence fixed.
- Per-device surfaces, set-persistent state, and tempo-aware clip export.
- Sampler browser drops [node.script] and previews through the track.
- midi-drums split into its own device; `s("bd:3")` plays the pad, not note 3.
- Native theming: Live CSS variables mapped to Tailwind.
- Play state exposed as a native Live parameter, synced with the UI.
- User-facing warnings for MAX_CYCLES capping and MIDI structure flattening.
- CI/CD pipeline (ci.yml + release.yml).
- Consumes @m4l-jweb 0.6.x / 0.7.0 from npm.

## 0.7.0 - 2026-07-13

Scale awareness and the Surface.

- Scale awareness, full-loop clip export, drum racks, and a live playhead.
- Strudel Audio FX: a real audio effect on the Surface.
- Upgraded to @m4l-jweb 0.3.0 / 0.4.0 (the Surface); dynamic sliders and an
  add-effect overlay panel.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-07-12

The engine leaves node.script; transport goes live.

- Strudel engine moves from [node.script] to a jweb Web Worker.
- Migrate to m4l-jweb 0.2.0: per-device bundles; the Instrument device dropped.
- LiveAPI transport polling plus a free-run clock; tempo observable.
- Fixes for dead LiveAPI observers (the loadbang loading-context trap), stale
  instances, and plugsync~ outlet mapping.
- Licensed AGPL-3.0-or-later; uses published @m4l-jweb packages.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-07 to 2026-07-11

First devices.

- Initial Max for Live MIDI device: Strudel mini-notation to MIDI clip and back,
  on the track it is dropped on.
- Headless Strudel engine plus a multi-device build pipeline.
- Three devices: MIDI sequencer, sample fetcher, and audio instrument (poly~
  synth voice).
- Self-contained .amxd with the UI embedded as a base64 payload in wrapper.js.
- node -> jweb return path, makenote flush, and 3-device installers.
